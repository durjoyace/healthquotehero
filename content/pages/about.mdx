# About Health Quote Hero

## Our Mission

Health Quote Hero was founded with a simple mission: **make health insurance understandable and accessible for every American**. In a world of confusing plans, changing subsidies, and complex Medicare rules, we believe everyone deserves clear guidance from licensed professionals who put your needs first.

## What We Do

We connect you with licensed insurance agents who specialize in:

- **ACA Marketplace Plans** - Individual and family health insurance with subsidy guidance
- **Medicare Advantage (Part C)** - All-in-one plans combining hospital, medical, and drug coverage
- **Medicare Supplement (Medigap)** - Plans that fill the gaps in Original Medicare
- **Medicare Part D** - Prescription drug coverage optimization

Our agents compare plans from 75+ insurance carriers including Aetna, Anthem Blue Cross Blue Shield, Cigna, Humana, Kaiser Permanente, UnitedHealthcare, Oscar Health, Ambetter, Molina, and many more.

## Our Commitment to You

### No Cost to You
Our service is completely free. We're compensated by insurance carriers when you enroll, so you get expert guidance at no additional cost.

### No Spam Calls
We respect your time and privacy. You'll only hear from licensed agents who can actually help with your coverage needs.

### Unbiased Advice
We work with dozens of carriers, not just one. Our agents recommend plans based on your needs, not carrier preferences.
